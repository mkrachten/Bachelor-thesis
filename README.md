This repository holds code and latex documents for my thesis

Background: In his Masters thesis, Steffen Reinert managed to take vast amount of pictures of the earth with the TU Berlin owned Satellite TechnoSat and geolocalized them. Due to measuring inaccuracies the positioning of the images is not yet accurate and shall be adjusted by georeferncing them. In order to do that, clouds have to be filtered first, as will lead to misinterpretation otherwise. In my thesis I will design and/or adjust a Convolutional Neural Network and an according dataset which is able to create a mask that classifies each pixel of an image as either cloud oder no cloud.
